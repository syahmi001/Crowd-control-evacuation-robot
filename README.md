# Crowd-control-evacuation-robot
This repository is made after my IDP project

First, this project used Arduino UNO and Raspberry Pi.

In the files "Tutorial Arduino" and "Tutorial Raspberry Pi" are the codes that I used to test all my components either 
they are working or not. These codes are also the initial set-up for my project. You might want to go through them in case
when you have difficulty in running the "Full code".

In the file "Full code (Arduino and Raspberry)", is the codes that I used to run my robot.

For Arduino, I simply used:
1. Arduino UNO board
2. Ultrasonic sensor
3. Servo
4. 2 motors (including motor driver)

For Raspberry Pi, my set-ups are:
1. I used Raspberry-Pi compatible camera (Noir series)
2. Raspberry pi 3 B+
3. OS Stretch (Operating system for raspberry pi)
4. OpenCV version 3+
5. Python 3

For installation guide for OpenCV, you can follow the installation guide here:
