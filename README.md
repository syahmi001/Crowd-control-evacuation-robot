# Crowd-control-evacuation-robot
This repository is made after my IDP project

First, this project used Arduino UNO and Raspberry Pi.

In the files "Tutorial Arduino" and "Tutorial Raspberry Pi" are the codes that I used to test all my components to check either 
they are working properly or not. These codes are also the initial set-up for my project. You might want to go through them in case
you encounter "problems" in running the "Full code".

In the file "Full code (Arduino and Raspberry)", are the codes that I used to run my robot.
If you correctly install everthing without messing with anything, the code will run correctly. 
You might need to change several lines and add some extension in the python module in case if it doens't run.

For Arduino, I simply used:
1. Arduino UNO board
2. Ultrasonic sensor
3. Servo
4. 2 motors (including motor driver)

For Raspberry Pi, my set-ups are:
1. I used Raspberry-Pi compatible camera (Noir series)
2. Raspberry pi 3 B+
3. OS Stretch (Operating system for raspberry pi)
4. OpenCV version 3+
5. Python 3

For installation guide for OpenCV3, you can follow the installation guide here:
